For this project we'll focus on the Bellabeat app. Now we want to know how FitBit users use FitBit to keep a track of their health. The data provided here may help us find the answer to the question How do our users use our smart devices?. In order to do so we need to find out which aspect of the device people like most and which will be most useful in providing the important information that the users seek.

# Phase-2 PREPARE
## Data Dictionary:







## Data Credibility and Integrity:
Due to the limitation of size (30 users) and not having any demographic information we could encounter a sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the population as a whole. Another problem we would encounter is that the dataset is not current and also the time limitation of the survey (2 months long).

# Phase-3 PROCESS

# Phase-4 ANALYSIS
In this phase of data analysis process we're going to-

* Aggregate the data so it’s useful and accessible.
* Organize and format the data.
* Perform calculations.
* Identify trends and relationships.

# Phase 5 SHARE
Since the dataset of FitBit Fitness Tracker users is rather small, I would recommend the keystakeholders to do further analysis with a bigger dataset to clearly find the patterns and user trends and take data driven decision.

But from this small sample size dataset we can still get some insights.The Bellabeat app can consider the following matrices to provide accurate informations about the daily activities of the users:

* Daily total steps
* Daily calories burned
* Daily active minutes
* Daily sedentary minutes
* Duration of sleeping (light, normal or over sleep)

As these variables are closely related to each other, one factor affects the others. Using the informations from those matrices the Bellabeat app can further give information about user's weight, heartrate, cholesterol level, and suggest healthy eating habits, recommed physical practices and back up their claims by providing scientific facts.


# Phase 6 : ACT

Some recommendation for the Bellabeat app:

* According to the CDC research taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps. But in our analysis, in case of lightly active and sedentary users it is very low(~6800 & ~2800 respectively). The Bellabeat app can remind the users to take at least 8000 steps explaining the benefits for their health.

* As users do more physical activity, they burn more calories, which in turn helps them lose more weight. In addition to giving daily updates on calorie burning, Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie intakes.

* If users want to improve their sleep, Bellabeat should consider using app notifications to go to bed and notify them if they've had enough sleep or if they overslept.

* The Bellabeat app can notify the users when they're sitting(sedentary time) for more than that is healthy, and remind them to do some light activity like, taking a stroll outside, or stretching up a bit etc.

* When a user does the recommended activities, the Bellabeat app can show motivational messages and reward them. That way the users will then be encouraged and they'll continue to do the hard work.
